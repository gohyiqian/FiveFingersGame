# My Mini Game
## An Overview
Hello.

This is a simple adaptation of the popular *Guitar Hero* Game first released in 2005.
Players will time the descending target and receive points when they keypress or mouseclick 'A','S','D','F','G' at the correct timing.

The game is created using custom functions of HTML canvas element.
Canvas is an HTML element that allows a user to create graphics, on the fly, using Javascript. It can be used to create animations, interactive graphics, and browser games.

Basic Animation Steps using canvas elements:
1. Draw the shapes to be animated
2. Define motion (translate/rotate/scale)
3. Clear the canvas
4. Update/Restore the canvas using either: setInterval, setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame functions

## Some To-Do List I have set for myself


- [ ] Add Start Scene
- [ ] Add How to Play Scene
- [ ] Add Playing Scene
- [ ] Add Game Over Scene
- [x] Create a canvas and add 5 buttons
- [x] Add mouse-click & keypress eventlisteners
- [x] Add corresponding colors when button is activated
- [x] Add some music effects when button is activated correctly vs wrongly
- [ ] Add requestAnimationFrame function to loop animations
- [ ] Define a threshold for 'correctness'
- [ ] Add scoring based of # of correct timing of activating the buttons
- [ ] Add gradient trail for movement

## Implementation

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add different songs

As Kanye West said:

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

    function fancyAlert(arg) {
      if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
      }
    }
