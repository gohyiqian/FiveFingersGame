# My Mini Game

Hello.

This is a simple adaptation of the popular *Guitar Hero* Game first released in 2005.
Players match colored notes that scroll down on screen to score points.

<canvas> is an HTML element that allows a user to create graphics using Javascript. It can be used to create animations, interactive graphics, and browser games.

## Some To-Do List I have set for myself

- [x] Create a canvas and add 5 buttons
- [x] Add mouse-click & keypress eventlisteners
- [x] Add corresponding colors when button is activated
- [x] Add some music effects when button is activated correctly vs wrongly
- [ ] Define a threshold for 'correctness'
- [ ] Add scoring based of timing of activating the buttons

As Kanye West said:

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

    function fancyAlert(arg) {
      if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
      }
    }
